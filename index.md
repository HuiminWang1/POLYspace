Identifying cellular neighborhoods is essential for understanding cell–cell interactions in a spatial context. However, existing approaches often overlook the complexity of multicellular interactions and the organization of spatial domains. We present POLYspace, a general and efficient framework for discovering and analyzing cellular neighborhoods of arbitrary topology accounting for spatial domains. POLYspace formulates neighborhood identification as a subgraph searching problem and leverages C3G, a fast graph canonization algorithm we developed, to achieve scalability. Applied to one in-house dataset and three publicly available datasets spanning diverse platforms and tissues, POLYspace uncovers domain-specific cellular neighborhoods that are not captured by existing methods. These neighborhoods reveal key biological mechanisms and improve phenotype prediction.
