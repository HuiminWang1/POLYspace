\usage{
neighborhoodAnnotation(
  POLYspace,
  region = TRUE,
  delimiter_node = "--",
  delimiter_region_celltype = "_",
  ncores = 1,
  mc.preschedule = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{POLYspace}{A \code{POLYspace} object.}

\item{region}{Logical; whether to include region-level information when
performing canonical neighborhood annotation.}

\item{delimiter_node}{Character; delimiter used between node labels during
annotation (default \code{"--"}).}

\item{delimiter_region_celltype}{Character; delimiter used between region and
cell type during annotation (default \code{"_"}).}

\item{ncores}{Integer; number of CPU cores to use. This is particularly useful
when targets are more complex than singlet and when multiple samples are
included in the \code{POLYspace} object. In this case, computations are
distributed across cores by combinations of samples and targets.}

\item{mc.preschedule}{Logical; passed to \code{parallel::mclapply()}.}
}
\value{
An updated \code{POLYspace} object with neighborhood annotations.
Each element of the list corresponds to a sample; within each sample,
each sub-list element corresponds to a target, with ordering consistent
with the \code{targets} slot.
}
\description{
Adds annotations to neighborhoods in a \code{POLYspace} object.
