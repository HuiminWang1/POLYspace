\title{Retrieve single-sample enrichment results}
\usage{
retrieveSingleResult(
  object,
  targets = "default",
  neighborhoods_of_interest = c("union", "intersect")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{A \code{POLYspace} object or a list of \code{POLYspace} objects.}

\item{targets}{Targets to include. \code{"default"} uses the union of targets
across all input objects.}

\item{neighborhoods_of_interest}{Neighborhoods to include in the feature matrix.
This can be specified as:
\itemize{
\item \code{"union"}: for each neighborhood shape, use the union of
neighborhoods observed across all samples;
\item \code{"intersect"}: for each neighborhood shape, use only neighborhoods
shared by all samples;
\item a user-defined list: a list whose elements correspond to targets, where
each element specifies the neighborhoods of interest for that target.
}}
}
\value{
A list with components:
\itemize{
\item \code{results}: a \code{data.table} containing single-sample
enrichment results;
\item \code{targets}: the targets used in the analysis.
}
}
\description{
Extracts per-sample enrichment results from a \code{POLYspace} object or from
a list of \code{POLYspace} objects.
}
