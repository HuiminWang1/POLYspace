\description{
A container for \code{POLYspace} analyses, storing inputs,
intermediate objects, and analysis results.
}
\section{Slots}{

\describe{
\item{\code{samples}}{\code{list}; per-sample tables. Each table typically contains
columns such as \code{id}, \code{x}, \code{y} (and optional \code{z} for 3D samples),
\code{celltype}, and \code{region} (which may be omitted if a global analysis is performed).}

\item{\code{nets}}{\code{list}; spatial adjacency networks for each sample.}

\item{\code{targets}}{\code{list}; specifications of neighborhood topologies used as targets
for neighborhood mining and enrichment analyses.}

\item{\code{neighborhoods}}{\code{list}; discovered neighborhoods per sample and target.
Each element of the list corresponds to a sample; within each sample,
each sub-list element corresponds to a target, with ordering consistent
with the \code{targets} slot.}

\item{\code{annotations}}{\code{list}; canonical labels assigned to discovered neighborhoods.
Each element of the list corresponds to a sample; within each sample,
each sub-list element corresponds to a target, with ordering consistent
with the \code{targets} slot.}

\item{\code{results}}{\code{list}; analysis outputs, including per-sample enrichment results
and group-level differential results.}

\item{\code{parameters}}{\code{list}; run-time parameters and analysis options.}
