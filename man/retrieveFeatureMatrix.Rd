\title{Retrieve neighborhood feature matrices}
\usage{
retrieveFeatureMatrix(
  object,
  region = TRUE,
  targets = "default",
  neighborhoods_of_interest = c("union", "intersect")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{A \code{POLYspace} object or a list of \code{POLYspace} objects.}

\item{region}{Logical; whether to use region-level neighborhoods when
constructing the feature matrix, which determines the level of enrichment
analysis to include.}

\item{targets}{Targets to include. \code{"default"} uses the union of targets
across all input objects.}

\item{neighborhoods_of_interest}{Neighborhoods to include in the feature matrix.
This can be specified as:
\itemize{
\item \code{"union"}: for each neighborhood shape, use the union of
neighborhoods observed across all samples;
\item \code{"intersect"}: for each neighborhood shape, use only neighborhoods
shared by all samples;
\item a user-defined list: a list whose elements correspond to targets, where
each element specifies the neighborhoods of interest for that target.
}}
}
\value{
A list containing:
\itemize{
\item \code{matrices}: a list of feature matrices, with ordering consistent
with the targets in the output list. Rows correspond to neighborhoods and
columns correspond to sample IDs;
\item \code{neighborhoods_info}: metadata describing the neighborhoods
included in the matrices, such as regional or cellular composition;
\item \code{targets}: the targets used for feature matrix retrieval.
}
}
\description{
Retrieves neighborhood-level feature matrices and related information from
a \code{POLYspace} object or a list of \code{POLYspace} objects.
